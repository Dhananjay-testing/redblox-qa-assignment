# Execution Summary

# Tests Passed:
9 out of 9 tests passed across all API and UI automation suites.

# Issues Found:
- DummyJSON API does not always persist created users, which can result in 404 responses. Tests were written to handle both persisted and non-persisted behavior.
- OrangeHRM UI contains dynamic selectors that occasionally change; stable text-based and fallback selectors were used to avoid flakiness.

# Improvements Made:
- Implemented fallback assertions to handle DummyJSON's non-persistent behavior.
- Added multiple selector strategies to stabilize OrangeHRM UI element identification.
- Structured tests into clear functional groups for maintainability.
- Added permission-denied simulation and negative test coverage for more robust flows.
